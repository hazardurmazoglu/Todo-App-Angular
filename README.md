# Todo App With Angular

For fonts, i used Font Awesome for Angular. For more information : https://github.com/FortAwesome/angular-fontawesome

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.1.

##Backend Server

run `npm run server` for a backend server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. JSON-Server, for more information : https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


# Things I Learned

Subscription and subject from RXJS for multicasting.
Event emitting, Input, Output.
Creating reusable component.
Two way binding in a good way.
JSON-Server as a temporary backend is really good solution for backend needs.






## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
